# Chroeo CLI Update Policy

## Update Frequency
We plan to release updates for the CLI on a bi-weekly basis, additionally, we may release unscheduled updates to 
address critical security vulnerabilities or introduce major new functionality

## Notification Strategy
New updates will be announced through the following channels:
- **In-tool notifications**: A message will be displayed within the CLI upon launch if a new version is available
- **Release notes**: Detailed information about each update including bug fixes, new features and breaking changes, will be published on the public repository

## Update Delivery Method
Updates will be delivered through the following methods,

### Package Managers(Not Available at now):
If installed via package manager updates will be available through the standard update mechanism of the particular package manager

### Installer Script:
Simply running the installer script will install the latest version of the CLI

## Rollback policy
If you encounter any issues with a new update, you can downgrade to the previous version by using the following command

```
# mac OS and linux
curl -o- https://cli.choreo.dev/install.sh | bash -s <release tag>

# windows
$arg = "<release-tag>"; $script = iwr https://cli.choreo.dev/install.ps1 -useb; & ([scriptblock]::Create($script)) $arg
```

## Breaking Changes
Significant changes that may break existing workflows will be clearly documented in the updateâ€™s release notes. 
We encourage users to review the release notes before installing an update to be aware of any potential issues

## Versioning Scheme
We use a <major>.<minor>.<patch> versioning scheme. Major releases introduce significant new features or breaking 
changes. Minor releases address bugs and introduce minor improvements. Patch releases fix critical security 
vulnerabilities
